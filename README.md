This is an app that tracks your cards throughout the game. Also includes a notes function and a multivariate hypergeometric distribution calculator for deckbuilding purposes. 


How to use:

To insert your deck, cards should be listed like this:

1x Blood Crypt;
7x Plains;

etc. 

Copy and Paste this into the entry with the arrow pointing at it. 

Then hit process. 

To move cards around the deck, use the 'From:', 'To:', 'Name', and 'Move' widgets. The names of the zones are: 'deck', 'play', 'grave', and 'exile'. The Name is just the name of the card. These are case sensitive. When you've enterd the zones and the name, hit the 'move' button. 

Whenever the turn is over, click the plus button next to the number that denotes the turn. The code will save where the cards are at during the end of the turn. 
To look back at a specific turn, input the turn number into the entry widget next to the button that says 'Turn:' and it will open a new window with the information. 

To get the notes function, press the notes button and it will open a new window with a text box. 

To use the calculator, press the button labelled 'Distribution calculator'. It will open a window with three buttons. Depending on the number of different cards in your combination, choose accordingly. Then fill out the details and click calculate.
